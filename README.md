# Gatsby Starter Catalyst Core

This implements only `gatsby-theme-catalyst-core` on which all other themes are based. This is probably too bare bones for most projects but could be a starting point if you wanted to build entirely custom headers and footers.

**Catalyzing Start**

```sh
# create a new Gatsby site using the catalyst core starter site
gatsby new catalyst-core https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-starter-catalyst-core
```
